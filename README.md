# LSTM_Nonlinear

I have been working with nonlinear dynamic systems for the entirety of my master's degree. For certain systems, it is simply impossible to account for all the factors and build a first-principles model, hence we rely on data-based models. Here, I used one such technique, particularly, using LSTM networks to model dynamic systems.
