# LSTM_Nonlinear

I have been working with nonlinear dynamic systems for the entirety of my master's degree. For certain systems, it is simply impossible to account for all the factors and build a first-principles model, hence we rely on data-based models. Here, I used one such technique, particularly, using LSTM networks to model dynamic systems. I have provided a step by step walkthrough in my article [here](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/hypothesis-testing-in-real-life-a-tale-of-sibling-rivalry-and-a-rubiks-cube-54cb1ee544c7?sk=04b5d727d46721b61e13edb3ce9c7ec4)
